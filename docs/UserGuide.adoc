What is _iGrad_?

_iGrad_ is the app to track your university progress, for students who are frustrated with the
limited features the university provides, by students who are frustrated by the limited
features the university provides.

_iGrad_ offers users the ability to create custom courses and graduation requirements,
ensuring the *maximum* degree of flexibility when planning and keeping track of your progress

_iGrad_ also retrieves data directly from https://nusmods.com[NUS Mods], ensuring that module
information is always up to date.

_iGrad_ calculates your CAP at every step, ensuring you never have to use a CAP calculator again

Finally, the _iGrad_ team is always open to feedback and suggestions from the public which
will always be followed up on.

==== Course

A course is simply a group of requirements. It is also how we keep track of your overall CAP
and MCs.

==== Requirements

A requirement consists of at least one module. Fulfill all modules within a requirement to
complete it.

==== Modules

A module is the building block of all other components. Mark your modules as done and give it
a grade. You can also add optional memos to help you remember why
you took the module.

=== Module

This section details each command used to manipulate modules. All module commands begin with the identifier
`module` followed by the action e.g. `add`.

All modules use the same parameters, listed in the table below:

[#tableModuleParameters]
.Module Parameters
|===
|Name| Description | Example | Restrictions

|`MODULE_CODE` | A module's unique identifier | CS2103T | Must have two letters in the front, four numbers in the middle with an optional letter at the back
|`MODULE_TITLE`| A module's title | Software Engineering |-
|`MODULE_CREDITS`| The number of http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/graduate/modular-system[modular credits] a module is worth | 4 | Must be a number
|`SEMESTER`| An academic semester. There are two semesters in a year | Y1S1 | Must be in the format Y?S* where ? represents a digit from 0 - 4 and * represents a digit from 1 -2
|`GRADE` | A module's grade | A+ | Must be one of the following:  A+, A, A-, B+, B-, C+, C, D, D+, F, S, U |
|===

If, when issuing a command, the parameter restrictions are not strictly adhered to,
you might come across some common errors.
The following errors are generic and may be encountered when dealing with any module command:

[#tableModuleParametersErrorReference]
.Module Parameters Error Reference
|===
|Parameter|Error Name

|`MODULE_CODE`| Invalid Module Code
|`MODULE_CREDITS`| Invalid Module Credits
|`SEMESTER`| Invalid Semester
|`GRADE`| Invalid Grade
|===

These errors can all be resolved by adhering to the restrictions detailed in <<tableModuleParameters>>

[#ModuleAddCommand]
==== Module Add

This command adds a module to the module list.

[#ModuleAddQuickReference]
.Module Add Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Adds a module
|Syntax| `module add n/MODULE_CODE t/MODULE_TITLE u/MODULE_CREDITS [s/SEMESTER]`
|Example | `module add n/CS2103T t/Software Engineering u/4 s/Y1S1`
|===

*How it Works*

When you type in this command, we take the given values for the `MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_TITLE`, `MODULE_CREDITS` and optionally, the `SEMESTER`,
and fill in those fields. We do not check if the given `MODULE_CODE` or `MODULE_TITLE` refer to actual modules offered by NUS. However, the restrictions stated in the module parameters table still apply.

<<ModuleAddErrorReference>> lists errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleAddErrorReference]
.Module Add Error Reference
|===
|Name | Message| Explanation| Solution

|Duplicate Module Error | Duplicate Detected| The module you are attempting to add already exists in the module list| Delete the existing module in the list and try again|
|===


*Tutorial*

Follow these steps to get a clearer idea of how this command works
[NOTE]
For this tutorial, actual values will be given instead of placeholders. Undo or Delete objects created from this tutorial by using the appropriate commands


1. Check that you do not have the modules with `MODULE_CODE` CS2103T and CS2101 in your list of modules

2. Type the following into the command box
`module add n/CS2103T u/4 t/Software Engineering` and press enter

3.  Type the following into the command box
`module add n/CS2101 u/4 t/Effective Communication for Computing Professionals` and press enter

4. The message in the response box should change and you should see the following in the module panel:

+
.Modules CS2103T and CS2101 successfully added
image::../images/user-guide\moduleAutoAddCommand\two_modules.png[]

[#ModuleAutoAddCommand]
==== Module Auto Add

This command adds a module to the module list. The module information is taken
from the https://api.nusmods.com/[NUSMods API] and includes the `MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_TITLE`
and `MODULE_CREDITS`.

[#ModuleAutoAddQuickReference]
.Module Auto Add Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Adds a module from NUSMods
|Syntax| `module add n/MODULE_CODE_A n/MODULE_CODE_B -a`
|Example | `module add n/CS2103T n/CS2101 -a`
|===

*How it Works*

IMPORTANT: Do not miss out the `-a` flag

When you type in this command, a request is made to https://api.nusmods.com/[NUSMods API]. More specifically, we visit the
module page and ask for the information provided there. An example page can be found https://api.nusmods.com/2018-2019/modules/CS2103T/[here].

[NOTE]
We try to get the module information from the current academic year. However,
this might not always be possible as NUS might not have released
the module details. As a contingency, we retrieve the module information from the
previous academic year.

In general, using this command speeds up the process of module addition greatly. However, as we have to make
a request to an external webpage, the time taken to process the request might be considerably longer.

[WARNING]
After issuing the command, the app might seem to freeze. Not to worry! It is merely processing your request. Please be patient when executing this command, especially when attempting to add a large number of modules.

This command also supports _batch processing_ and you can add multiple modules, with the necessary information all
filled in, by issuing a single command. In the case where adding a single module in a batch of modules raises an error,
we skip that module and let you know what went wrong.

[TIP]
You can add up to 10 modules at once! Try this: `module add n/CS1101 n/CS1231 n/CS2030 n/CS2040 n/CS2100 n/CS2103T n/CS2105 n/CS2106 n/CS3230 n/CS3219 -a`

<<ModuleAutoAddErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleAutoAddErrorReference]
.Module Auto Add Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Duplicate Module Error | Duplicate Detected| The module you are attempting to add already exists in the module list| Delete the existing module in the list and try again
|Module Not Found Error| Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to add could not be found on the NUSMods API |  Use the command <<ModuleAddCommand>> instead
|Module Overload Error | Module Overload Error|You attemped to add too many modules. The limit is 10| Divide the list of modules into smaller batches of size less than 10 and try again
|Connection Error I | Connection Error| You are not connected to the internet| Whilst all other commands work offline. You need an internet connection to issue this command. Go online before trying again
|Connection Error II | Connection Error| The NUSMods API server is down| Use the command module add instead or wait until the NUSMods API server is restored
|===

*Tutorial*

Follow these steps to get a clearer idea of how this command works

[NOTE]
For this tutorial, actual values will be given instead of placeholders. Undo or Delete objects created from this tutorial by using the appropriate commands

1. Check that you do not have the modules with `MODULE_CODE` CS2103T and CS2101 in your list of modules

2. Type the following into the command box
`module add n/CS2103T n/CS2101 -a` and press enter

3. Wait for up to 5 seconds

4. The message in the response box should change and you should see the following in the module panel

+
.Modules CS2103T and CS2101 successfully added from NUSMods
image::../images/user-guide\moduleAutoAddCommand\two_modules.png[]

*Additional Information*

We are also able to retrieve information pertaining to a module's prerequisites and preclusions. However, as our app can function as a module planner
in addition to tracking your graduation requirements, we do not prevent you from adding modules that have unfulfilled prerequisites but instead, simply show a warning.

WARNING: As the prerequisites and preclusions from NUSMods do not follow any standard formatting, the warning messages shown might not
always be accurate. This is due to a difficulty of interpreting
the data given by NUSMods. This remains a BETA feature and we hope to upgrade it in time.

==== Module Done

This command marks a module as done by giving it a grade and optionally, a semester.

.Module Done Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Marks a module as done
|Syntax| `module done MODULE_CODE g/GRADE [s/SEMESTER]`
|Example | `module done CS2103T g/A s/Y1S1`
|===

*How it Works*

When you issue the command, we give your module the grade, and optionally the semester, that you provided. This helps us keep track of both your CAP and the number
of semesters you have left before graduating.

In order to calculate your CAP, we use a known algorithm which is guaranteed to be accurate. To see what semester you are currently at, we
take the latest semester given to a module which has been marked as done. From that, we are able to tell you how many semesters you have left.

[NOTE]
We do not currently allow the input of special terms. As a workaround, for modules taken
during special term, you could input the most recent semester instead

<<ModuleDoneErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleDoneErrorReference]
.Module Done Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Module Not Found Error | Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to mark as done does not exist in the module list| Add the module you wish to mark as done and try again
|===

*Tutorial*

[NOTE]
For this tutorial, actual values will be given instead of placeholders. Undo or Delete objects created from this tutorial by using the appropriate commands

Ensure that you have the module CS2103T in the module list

1. Type the following into the command box `module done CS2103T g/A s/Y4S1`

2. The message in the response box should change and you should see the following

+
.Modules CS2103T successfully given a grade and a semester
image::../images/user-guide\moduleAutoAddCommand\one_module.png[]

==== Module Edit

This command edits the editable fields in a module which include the `MODULE_TITLE`, `MODULE_CREDITS`, `SEMESTER`.
Although it is possible to edit the fields as listed, it is unadvisable unless you made a mistake while keying
in the values.

.Module Edit Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Edits a module
|Syntax| `module edit MODULE_CODE [t/MODULE_TITLE] [u/MODULE_CREDITS] [s/SEMESTER]`
|Example | `module edit CS2103T t/Hardware Engineering u/8 s/Y1S2`
|===

*How it Works*

When you issue the command, we replace the fields provided with the given values. You are able to
change the values as you wish as long as they follow the restrictions as listed in the parameters table.

<<ModuleEditErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleEditErrorReference]
.Module Edit Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Module Not Found Error | Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to edit does not exist in the module list| Instead of editing a module that does not exist, try adding a new one!
|===

*Tutorial*

[NOTE]
For this tutorial, actual values will be given instead of placeholders. Undo or Delete objects created from this tutorial by using the appropriate commands

Ensure that you have the module CS2103T in the module list

2. The message in the response box should change and you should see the following

+
.Modules CS2103T successfully given a grade and a semester
image::../images/user-guide\moduleAutoAddCommand\module_edit.png[]

==== Module Delete

This command deletes a module from the module list.

.Delete Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Deletes a module
|Syntax| `module delete MODULE_CODE`https://xxx[]
|Example | `module delete CS2103T`
|===

*How it Works*

The module that you wish to delete is completely removed from the module list.
[WARNING]
Restoring the module is only possible using the `undo` command which would only work if `delete` was the last issued command.

<<ModuleDeleteErrorReference>> lists the errors you might encounter after issuing this command:

[#ModuleDeleteErrorReference]
.Module Delete Error Reference
|===
|Name| Message| Explanation |Solution

|Module Not Found Error | Module Not Found| The module you are attempting to delete does not exist in the module list| Your problem is your solution!
|===

*Tutorial*

[NOTE]
For this tutorial, actual values will be given instead of placeholders. Undo or Delete objects created from this tutorial by using the appropriate commands

Ensure that you have the module CS2103T in the module list

1. Type the following into the command box `module delete CS2103T`

2. The message in the response box should change and you should see that the module CS2103T disappears from the module list

==== Module Filter

This command allows you to find your modules by various parameters. You can filter the
complete module list by `SEMESTER`, `MODULE_CREDITS` and `GRADE`.

.Filter Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Displays a module list filtered based on the given parameters
|Syntax| `module filter [s/SEMESTER] [u/MODULE_CREDITS] [g/GRADE] [-o]`
|Example | `module filter s/Y1S1 u/4 g/A -o`
|===

*How it Works*

Two options are provided for you:

[Option 1] Displays modules that match all provided parameters

or

[Option 2] Displays modules that match at least one of the provided parameters.

If the flag `-o` is included at the end of the command, Option 2 will be chosen. Otherwise, the default option is Option 1.

IMPORTANT: In order to display all modules once again, simply type `module filter`. This will display an unfiltered module list containing all modules.

There are no notable errors to list. If wrong parameters are given, the app will simply
display the unfiltered module list. However, you should always take note of what filters are currently in place. If you
are unable to find some modules after using this command, please reset the display by typing in `module filter`.

WARNING: If you
are unable to find some modules after using this command, please reset the display by typing in `module filter`.

*Tutorial*

Ensure that the following modules are in the module list:
|===
|Module Code| Credits|Semester| Grade

|CS2103T|4|Y1S1|A
|CS2101|4|Y1S2|B
|CS2040|6|Y2S1|C
|===

 . Type `module filter u/4` into the command box
 . The message in the response box should change and you should see the modules CS2103T and CS2101 in the module panel

 .. Retrieving modules which have either `SEMESTER` Y1S2 or `GRADE` C
. Type `module filter s/Y1S1 g/B -o`
. The message in the response box should change and you should see the modules CS2101 and CS2040 in the module panel


*Additional Information*

[NOTE]
This section contains information which requires prior knowledge of discrete mathematics or more specifically, logical operators

The flag `-o`, is present, sets the logical operator used in concatenating the parameters as _"or"_. The default logical operator used is _"and"_.

'''
=== Export

This command exports your data to a comma-separated values (.csv) file. This file can then be submitted to the relevant
administration for processing of Leave of Absence (LOA), exchange programmes or internship applications.

.Export Quick Reference
|===
|Purpose | Exports your data to a .csv file
|Syntax| `export`
|Example | `export`
|===

*How it Works*

We write your data to a .csv file _study_plan.csv_ using the modules you have added and include the fields `MODULE_CODE`, `MODULE_TITLE`, `SEMESTER` and `CREDITS`.

.Study Plan Example CSV
