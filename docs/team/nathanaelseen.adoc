== Overview

iGrad is a desktop module management and graduation tracking application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX, FXML and CSS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/commits?author=nathanaelseen[All commits]] [https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&search=nathanaelseen[Project Code Dashboard]]

* *Major enhancement*: Added *course management* feature.
** _What it does_: Allows the user to create/edit/delete a course, through which various modules,
and requirements (degree requirements) are 'housed'. Also allows users to track other
import degree progress information, such as overal MCs completed for the course, and current CAP.
** _Justification_: This feature is crucial because our application is a course management app, which
helps students plan their graduation requirements. Without a course, it does not make sense to
have modules and degree requirements (by which those modules are mapped under). In fact, it could
be said to be the most important feature.
** _Credits_: The original AB3 codebase which provided the necessary backing for the implementation
of this feature, and my teamates for implementing the *module management* and *requirement
management* features.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to mark a module as 'done'*
** _What it does_: allows the user to record down the grade she has obtained for a particular
module she has completed.
** _Justification_: Again this feature is particularly important, in helping one track her graduation
requirements and overall degree progress, as a module is a basic unit of a course.
** _Highlights_: This feature functions like 'glue' in the entire application, glueing the
*module management*, *requirement management*, and *course management* all together. It might
seem trivial, but when a module is marked as 'done' with a certain grade recorded for it, first
of all, the _module manager_ has to be called so as to update the module with that grade. Next,
the _requirement manager_ has to also be invoked to updated all requirements which contains
this module with this new module information, as well as recompute the total MCs fulfilled
for those requirements. Finally, the _course manager_ has to called as well, as the total
MCs fulfilled for the course needs to be updated, and the CAP needs to be recomputed.
** _Credits_: Here, I would like to credit the rest of my teamates for implementing the module
management and requirement management feature, without which this feature would not have
been able to make sense.


* *Minor enhancement*: did the logic and interface to select an animal guide

* *Minor enhancement*: added a quote generator that displays a random quote each time a command is entered

* *Documentation*:

* *Contribution to Team Based Tasks*:
** In-charge of merging any pull request in the team, this involves critically reviewing the code,
and fixing it if necessary. Things I checked/helped my teamates fix upon merging any pull request were;
violating checkstyle, obvious logic bug errors, design/implementation considerations and concerns.
Also, before I give the thumbs-up for merging those PRs, I always help my teamates test
the features they implemented, i.e, whether it works as 'advertised'. Oftentimes, I find some
loopholes in the features and I report it back to them.

** Set-up Reposense, and Nelify for my team, for tracking code contributions and easy reviewing of
UG/DG docs.

* *Review/Mentoring Contributions*:
** Assisted https://github.com/teriaiw[Teri], in her initial difficulties understanding and
adapting to such a large code-base, by creating stubs for her implementation. She feedback that
she liked my way of mentoring and found my mentoring to be really helpful. I also provided her
a listening ear for any difficulties or concerns she has when implementing her portions.
