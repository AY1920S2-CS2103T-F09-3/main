== Overview

iGrad is a desktop module management and graduation tracking application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX, FXML and CSS.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *architecture for requirements and integrating the requirement feature with the course and module features*.
** _What it does_: Provides the requirement structure where modules can be assigned to, to keep track of the progress of a requirement.
** _Justification_: This feature is crucial in providing the ability for users to keep track of their graduation status through smaller categories known as requirements, instead of directly under a course.
** _Highlights_: This enhancement greatly increases the usability of the application because it makes course completion easier to track. It was also difficult to integrate this together with the course feature and the module feature since the code for this feature had to be written from scratch.
** _Credits_: The original Address Book 3 code which I referenced from the AddressBook structure as well as the Person structure to create this feature.

* *Major enhancement*: Added the *ability to add, edit and delete requirements*.
** _What it does_: Allows the user to add, edit and delete requirements.
** _Justification_: This feature improves the product significantly because it provides the flexibility for users to add their own requirement categories, edit them, and delete them if no longer needed.
** _Highlights_: Ensured that all the requirement properties, such as credits, are up-to-date after every command. I initially updated this in the command itself for efficiency, but this design was not modular since anyone creating a new requirement instance had to do the calculation themselves. So I chose modularity over efficiency and left the calculation in the requirement class instead.
** _Credits_: The original Address Book 3 code which I referenced to create the commands.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added the *ability to keep track of requirements being fulfilled*.

* *Contribution to Team Based Tasks*:
** Refactored the entire Address Book 3 into iGrad at the initial stage, while making sure the tests still pass such that my teammates can work on the refactored code in peace.
** Managed the issue tracker throughout the semester, helping the team add issues and document bugs found along the way.
** Created the first mock User Guide with all the commands needed by our application, to set the direction for the application.

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** In charge of delegation of work and ensuring that the team completes their work on time
** Enhancements to existing features:
*** Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])
** Documentation:
*** Did cosmetic tweaks to existing contents of the User Guide: https://github.com[#14]
** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])
** Tools:
*** Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
*** Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
