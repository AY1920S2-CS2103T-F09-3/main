==== Implementation

Section by: https://github.com/nathanaelseen[Nathanael Seen]


In the implementation of the course feature which 'houses' the various xref:anchor-tag-c[`Requirements`]
and the xref:anchor-tag-b[`Modules`] mapped under those requirements, a `CourseInfo` class is
necessary in order to represent overall course information, such as the name of the course, the
current cap of the student (or user), the total credits (MCs) fulfilled/required, and
semesters left before she could graduate.

These important information are encapsulated in the `CourseInfo` class which should only
have one `Name`, one `Cap`, one `Credits` and one `Semesters` object(s), at any one time:

Also, as per the diagram above, we note that these fields (in a `CourseInfo`) are optional,
because a user might not even have a course set in the first place. This occurs when the
application is started out in a 'blank' state, with no initial or sample data.

===== Compute Cap

Similar to `Credits`, `Cap` has to be updated frequently, each time module information
in `coursebook` changes, and the static method, `computeCap(...)`, facilitates the recomputation of the
updated `Cap`.

The diagram below describes the interactions between the various classes, as the computation
is performed:

We note that from above, `CourseInfo` does most of the interfacing with other classes,
and the rest of the classes don't interact with each another.

In summary, the following steps are performed as `computeCap(...)` is invoked:

(For each `Module` in the `moduleList`):

. `CourseInfo` first iterates through `reqList` to determine if a `Module` belongs to any `Requirement`
. If it does, `CourseInfo` again interfaces with `Module` to extract its `Grade`.
. Finally, `CourseInfo` interacts with `Grade` to determine if the `Grade` is a non-SU grade.
. If the `Grade` is non-SU, the `Module` is factored into Cap computation.

==== Module Done

Section by: https://github.com/nathanaelseen[Nathanael Seen]

===== Overview

This feature enables students to mark a module which they have completed with a certain grade.
Once a module is marked 'done', it would be counted to graduation requirements.

===== Implementation

Trivial as it might seem, there are actually quite a number of `coursebook` data which needs to
be updated when a module is marked 'done'.

This includes the `Module` itself, the various `Requirements` in the `UniqueRequirementList`,
and the `CourseInfo`.

The following diagram illustrates this:

As from the above, there are two possible scenarios; either a `Module` belongs to at least one
`Requirement` or that it does not belong to any `Requirement`.

In the latter case, calls to methods which update `CourseInfo` would be immediately invoked,
bypassing the updating of the `Requirement(s)`.
