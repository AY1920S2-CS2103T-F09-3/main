<p>iGrad is a desktop module management and graduation tracking application. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX, FXML and CSS.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-contributions"><a class="link" href="#summary-of-contributions">Summary of contributions</a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Code contributed</strong>: [<a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/commits?author=nathanaelseen">All commits</a>] [<a href="https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#=undefined&amp;search=nathanaelseen">Project Code Dashboard</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Added <strong>course management</strong> feature.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>What it does</em>: Allows the user to create/edit/delete a course, through which various modules,
and requirements (degree requirements) are 'housed'. Also allows users to track other
import degree progress information, such as overal MCs completed for the course, and current CAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Justification</em>: This feature is crucial because our application is a course management app, which
helps students plan their graduation requirements. Without a course, it does not make sense to
have modules and degree requirements (by which those modules are mapped under) as standalone
features. In fact, this feature could be said to be the most important feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Credits</em>: The original AB3 codebase which provided the necessary backing for the implementation
of this feature, and my teamates for implementing the <strong>module management</strong> and <strong>requirement
management</strong> features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: Integrate <strong>course management</strong>, <strong>requirement management</strong>, and <strong>module management</strong>
feature together, through the <code>module done</code>,  <code>requirement assign</code>, and <code>requirement unassign</code>,
commands.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>What it does</em>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>module done</code>: allows the user to record down the grade she has obtained for a particular
module she has completed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>requirement assign</code>: allows the user to assign certain modules under a requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>requirement unassign</code>: opposite of requirement assign</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Justification</em>: Again this feature is particularly important, in helping one track her graduation
requirements and overall degree progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Highlights</em>: This three commands function like a 'glue' in the entire application, glueing the
<strong>module management</strong>, <strong>requirement management</strong>, and <strong>course management</strong> altogether.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take for example, the <code>module done</code> command. It might seem trivial, but when a
module is marked as 'done' with a certain grade recorded for it, first of all,
the <em>module manager</em> has to be called so as to update the module with that grade.
Next, the <em>requirement manager</em> has to also be invoked to updated all requirements which contains
this module with this new module information, as well as recompute the total MCs fulfilled
for those requirements. Finally, the <em>course manager</em> has to called as well, as the total
MCs fulfilled for the course needs to be updated, and the CAP needs to be recomputed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Credits</em>: Here, I would like to credit the rest of my teamates for implementing the module
management and requirement management feature, without which this feature would not have
been able to make sense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: remodularise animal guide (avatar) selection logic,
which <a href="https://github.com/waynewee">Wayne</a>, has initially written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: assisted in updating of UI information for course information (left
most panel in screenshot above),
which <a href="https://github.com/waynewee">Wayne</a>, has initially written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Contribution to Team Based Tasks</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In-charge of merging any pull request in the team, this involves critically reviewing the code,
and fixing it if necessary.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Things I checked/helped my teamates fix upon merging any pull request were;
violating checkstyle, obvious logic bug errors, design/implementation considerations and concerns,
remodularising of code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, before I give the thumbs-up for merging those PRs, I always help my teamates test
the features they implemented, i.e, whether it works as 'advertised'. Sometimes, when I test
their features with the latest code in 'master' branch, it does not work as 'advertised', due
to integration issues. In those cases, I helped to pinpoint exact location of fault,
and feedback to them for further fixing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somehow in my role of merging PRs, I was also part of the initial refactoring of the codebase.
This was because two of my teamates refactored the codebase at the same time, causing
a very huge merge <a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/pull/93">conflict</a> which I had to resolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides that, other merge conflicts I helped resolved while merging are;
<a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/pull/320">#320</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/pull/307">#307</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-3/main/pull/295">#295</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set-up Reposense, and Nelify for my team, for tracking code contributions and easy reviewing of
UG/DG docs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remind my teamates on upcoming deadlines; submission of UG, DG, milestone deadline tasks, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Managed the issue tracker for the first-half of this project, creating and assigning issues
to track the progress of my teamates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designed the initial application UI prototype for the first draft UG submission.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review/Mentoring Contributions</strong>:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assisted <a href="https://github.com/teriaiw">Teri</a>, in her initial difficulties understanding and
adapting to such a large code-base, by creating stubs for her implementation. She feedbacked that
she liked my way of mentoring and found it to be really helpful. I also provided her
a listening ear for voicing any difficulties or concerns she had when implementing her code
portions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provided PR code reviews to my team members on how potential things they could improve
and work on, as I merged their PRs

<p>This segment highlights three key features iGrad offers to NUS students, namely;
a Course Planner, an MCs Tracker, and a CAP Tracker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would like a more in-depth overview of the actual components of our application, please
refer to the next section; <a href="#components">Components</a>, for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="course-planner"><a class="link" href="#course-planner">Course Planner</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>iGrad</em> was built with every NUS student in mind. Our flexible course planner allows you to plan
a course of your own dreams, be it those of you doing a single degree programme,
a double degree programme, and even a concurrent degree programme.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With our course planner, you would be able to enter your current course details such as your
<strong>modules</strong> and the various degree <strong>requirements</strong> by which those modules are mapped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(For instance, the <em>Computer Science</em> course has the various
<strong>modules</strong>, highlighted in <span class="blue">blue</span>, and degree <strong>requirements</strong>, boxed in <span class="red">red</span>):</p>

<h4 id="mcs-tracker"><a class="link" href="#mcs-tracker">MCs Tracker</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are sick of counting our MCs at the beginning of every semester; be it counting the
total course MCs left before you can graduate, or tracking the number of MCs left
for those invidual degree requirements (boxed in <span class="green">green</span>,
in <a href="#figure-a-anchor"><em>Figure 1</em></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With our MCs feature, you would be able to easily keep track of how close you are to
graduation, as all this information is automatically updated and recomputed, each time you have
completed a certain module.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="cap-tracker"><a class="link" href="#cap-tracker">CAP Tracker</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No more googling for CAP calculators. iGrad&#8217;s CAP tracker helps you keeps track of your current CAP at
every step of your journey in your course. In addition, it even offers predictive features so you know how
well you have to do in order to achieve your dream CAP.</p>

<h4 id="course"><a class="link" href="#course">Course</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A course is simply a group of degree requirements.</p>

<em>Mathematics and Sciences</em>, and <em>Unrestricted Electives</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each requirement comprises of the modules you need to complete in order to fulfill that particular
requirement.</p>
