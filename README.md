## Introduction

Sick of having tracking your university progress the manual way? 
Start getting rid of your Excel sheets and scribbled down notes and download *iGrad* right now!

What is *iGrad*? 

*iGrad* is the app to track your university progress, for students who are frustrated with the
limited features the university provides, by students who are frustrated by the limited
features the university provides. 

*iGrad* offers users the ability to create custom courses and graduation requirements,
ensuring the **maximum** degree of flexibility when planning and keeping track of your progress

*iGrad* also retrieves data directly from [NUS Mods](https://nusmods.com), ensuring that module
information is always up to date.

*iGrad* calculates your CAP at every step, ensuring you never have to use a CAP calculator again

Finally, the *iGrad* team is always open to feedback and suggestions from the public will always be followed up on.

## Features  

#### Course Builder
iGrad was built with every NUS student in mind. Our custom course builder allows you to build
the course of your dreams.

#### Modular Credits (MCs) Tracker
We are sick of counting our MCs at the beginning of every semester too. Easily see how many MCs you
have left in order to apply for graduation.

#### Cumulative Average Point (CAP) Tracker
No more googling CAP calculators. iGrad's CAP tracker keeps track of your CAP at every step and
even offers predictive services so you know how well you have to do
in order to achieve your dream Cumulative Point Average (CAP).

#### Courses
A course is simply a group of requirements. It is also how we keep track of your overall CAP
and MCs. 

#### Requirements
A requirement consists of at least one module. Fulfill all modules within a requirement to
complete it.

#### Modules
A module is the building block of all other components. Mark your modules as done and give it
a grade. You can also add optional memos to help you remember why
you took the module.
